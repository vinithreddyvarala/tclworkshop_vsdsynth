__*Author: Varala Vinith Reddy*__

## INTRODUCTION

In the VLSI industry, TCL (Tool Command Language) is widely used for scripting and automation in electronic design automation (EDA) tasks. It is used for tasks such as automating design setup, simulation, synthesis, timing analysis, and verification. TCL is also used to define design constraints, integrate different EDA tools, write testbenches, perform chip testing, and customize and extend tool functionality. Overall, TCL plays a critical role in streamlining the design flow and improving productivity in the VLSI industry.
